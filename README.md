The application is a JavaScript-based template generator for creating customizable grids in different paper formats such as a2, a3, and a4. The generator allows users to create grids with 8 rows and 5 columns, with the option to adjust the width and height of each grid. In the top right corner of each grid, there is a number indicating its position, while on the left side, there is a short text description. The generator also provides the ability to download an image of the generated grid for use in selling posters on a web shop.
