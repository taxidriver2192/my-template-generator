# Why does project?
The application is a Vue template generator for creating customizable grids in different paper formats such as a2, a3, and a4. The generator allows me to create grids with 8 rows and 5 columns, with the option to adjust the width and height of each grid.

In the top right corner of each grid, there is a number indicating its position, while on the left side, there is a short text description. 
In the later stages I also want to save and include images, possible to add custom writings to personalize the posters.

The generator also provides the ability to download an image so I can get them printed and made.

## The goal of this project
It's to have a fast way of producing different posters with a different layout, I'm trying to sell the poster online at [etsy](https://www.etsy.com/dk-en/shop/iPhoneBlueprints)
